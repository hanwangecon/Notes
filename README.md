# Notes

**My thought process of setting up this repository**

* Pros: can keep a record of insights from wonderful thinkers; can avoid catastrophic data loss due to my bad memory; can mark my "marginal gains" from inputting all sorts of information; can HOPEFULLY generate some positive externalities...

* Cons: can substitute leisure; can be costly in efforts (typing things up sometimes drives me crazy); cannot pay-off in short terms...

OK, I probably need this. (The intuition is simple, although calculations are long and tedious)

These notes may not limited to specific subjects or genres:

#Economics #Math #Philosophy #Literature #CS

I will do my best to specify the references. Contact me if I didn't do well.
